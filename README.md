# SISTEM-OPERASI

## Operating System Repository

Welcome to the Operating System Repository!

This repository is created to store various results of practical work and assignments related to the Operating System course in the curriculum of the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology (ITS). The materials in this repository are related to software development in the Linux environment, with a focus on the Ubuntu distribution. The primary programming language used is Shell, but it also includes the possibility of using other languages such as C to access programs related to the operating system.

### Repository Structure:

1. **Practicals**: This directory contains the results of completed practical work. Each practical is organized in a directory corresponding to its number or topic.

2. **Assignments**: This directory contains completed assignments, separate from practical work. Each assignment is grouped in a directory corresponding to its name or number.

3. **References**: This directory contains references, notes, or other supporting materials useful for understanding concepts and implementations in Operating Systems.

### User Guide:

1. Make sure you have installed a Linux operating system, preferably the Ubuntu distribution.

2. To run Shell scripts, ensure you have given execute permission to the file. You can do this with the command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x filename.sh
   ```

3. For programs written in C, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (usually GCC). Compile the program using the command:

   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```

4. Run the compiled program with the command:

   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

5. Some files may need to be converted to dos2unix format to avoid errors, especially if they have not been converted previously. You can do this conversion using the `dos2unix` command. For example:

   ```bash
   dos2unix filename.txt
   ```
